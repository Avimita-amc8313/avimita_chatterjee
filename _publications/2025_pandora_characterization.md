excerpt: 'We examine how different noise types impact QECCs, considering the varying susceptibility of quantum systems to specific errors. Our goal is to identify opportunities to minimize the resources—or overhead—needed for effective error correction. We conduct a detailed study on two QECCs—rotated and unrotated surface codes—under various noise models using simulations'
