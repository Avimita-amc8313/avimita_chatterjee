excerpt: 'Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET) are infrastructure-less networks in which groups of nodes collaborate by forwarding packets such that each node can function without a common access point. The mobile nature of MANETs result in degradation of battery life and efficient routing is, thus, necessary for reducing energy consumption. In this paper we modify the existing AODV protocol to decrease energy required during transmission by reduction of packet size and maintain an Energy/Distance ratio as a metric for tracing the best route. By combining these features we reduce required transmission power, as well as increase battery life.'
