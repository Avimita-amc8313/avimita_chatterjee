excerpt: 'We introduce a novel technique that enables observation of quantum states without direct measurement, preserving them for reuse. Our method allows multiple quantum states to be observed at different points within a single circuit, one at a time, and saved into classical memory without destruction. These saved states can be accessed on demand by downstream applications, introducing a dynamic and programmable notion of quantum memory that supports modular, non-destructive quantum workflows. We propose a hardware-agnostic, machine learning-driven framework to capture non-destructive estimates, or "snapshots," of quantum states at arbitrary points within a circuit, enabling classical storage and later reconstruction, similar to memory operations in classical computing.'
