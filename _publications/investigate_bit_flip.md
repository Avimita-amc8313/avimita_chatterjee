excerpt: 'In this paper, we investigate the impact of bit-flip errors in FPGA memories in control electronics on quantum computing systems. FPGA memories are integral in storing the amplitude and phase information pulse envelopes, which are essential for generating quantum gate pulses. However, these memories can incur faults due to physical and environmental stressors such as electromagnetic interference, power fluctuations, and temperature variations and adversarial fault injections, potentially leading to errors in quantum gate operations.
