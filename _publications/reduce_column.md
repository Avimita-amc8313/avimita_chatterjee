excerpt: 'To apply QEC, a circuit must first be transformed into a non-Clifford (or T) gate set. T-depth, the number of sequential T-gate layers, determines the magic state cost, impacting both spatial and temporal overhead. Minimizing T-depth is crucial for optimizing resource efficiency in fault-tolerant quantum computing. While QEC scalability has been widely studied, T-depth reduction remains an overlooked challenge. We establish that T-depth reduction is an NP-hard problem and systematically evaluate multiple approximation techniques: greedy, divide-and-conquer, Lookahead-based brute force, and graph-based.'
