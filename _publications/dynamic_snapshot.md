excerpt: 'We propose Quantum Snapshot with Dynamic Circuit (QSDC), a hardware-agnostic, learning-driven framework for capturing quantum snapshots: non-destructive estimates of quantum states at arbitrary points within a quantum circuit, which can then be classically stored and later reconstructed. This functionality is vital for introspection, debugging, and memory in quantum systems, yet remains fundamentally constrained by the no-cloning theorem and the destructive nature of measurement. QSDC introduces a guess-and-check methodology in which a classical model, powered by either gradient-based neural networks or gradient-free evolutionary strategie, is trained to reconstruct an unknown quantum state using fidelity from the SWAP test as the sole feedback signal. Our approach supports single-copy, mid-circuit state reconstruction, assuming hardware with dynamic circuit support and sufficient coherence time. '
