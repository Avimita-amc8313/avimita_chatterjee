excerpt: 'Traditionally, simulators operate in a forward paradigm, taking parameters such as distance, rounds, and physical error to output a logical error rate. However, usage of maximum distance and rounds of the surface code might waste resources. An approach that relies on trial and error to fine-tune QEC code parameters using simulation tools like STIM can be exceedingly time-consuming. Additionally, daily fluctuations in quantum error rates can alter the ideal QEC settings needed. As a result, there is a crucial need for an automated solution that can rapidly determine the appropriate QEC parameters tailored to the current conditions. To bridge this gap, we present MITS, a tool designed to reverse-engineer the well-known simulator STIM for designing QEC codes. MITS accepts the specific noise model of a quantum computer and a target logical error rate as input and outputs the optimal surface code rounds and code distances.'
