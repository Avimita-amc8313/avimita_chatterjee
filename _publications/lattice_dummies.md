excerpt: 'Lattice surgery is crucial for enabling interactions among multiple encoded qubits or between the lattices of a surface code, ensuring that its sophisticated error-correcting features are maintained without significantly increasing the operational overhead. Lattice surgery is pivotal for scaling QECCs across more extensive quantum systems. Despite its critical importance, comprehending lattice surgery is challenging due to its inherent complexity, demanding a deep understanding of intricate quantum physics and mathematical concepts. This paper endeavors to demystify lattice surgery, making it accessible to those without a profound background in quantum physics or mathematics.'
