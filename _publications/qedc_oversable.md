excerpt: 'Simulating dynamics of physical systems is a key application of quantum computing, with potential impact in fields such as condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry. However, current quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation yield results that are inadequate for real use cases and suffer from lengthy execution times when implemented on near-term quantum hardware. In this work, we introduce a framework for evaluating the performance of quantum simulation algorithms, focusing on the computation of observables, such as energy expectation values. Our framework provides end-to-end demonstrations of algorithmic optimizations that utilize Pauli term groups based on k-commutativity, generate customized Clifford measurement circuits, and implement weighted shot distribution strategies across these groups.
