excerpt: 'This study makes a pioneering contribution by applying quantum error correction codes (QECCs) for complex, multi-qubit classification tasks. We implement 1-qubit and 2-qubit quantum classifiers with QECCs, specifically the Steane code, and the distance 3 & 5 surface codes to analyze 2-dimensional and 4-dimensional datasets. This research uniquely evaluates the performance of these QECCs in enhancing the robustness and accuracy of quantum classifiers against various physical errors, including bit-flip, phase-flip, and depolarizing errors.'
