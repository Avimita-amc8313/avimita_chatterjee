excerpt: 'Despite significant improvements in the field of QECCs, a unified methodology for evaluating them consistently has remained elusive. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a set of eight universal parameters and evaluating nine prominent QECCs for these parameters. We establish a universal benchmarking approach and highlight the complexity of quantum error correction, indicating that the choice of a QECC depends on each scenario's unique requirements and limitations. Furthermore, we develop a systematic strategy for selecting QECCs that adapts to the specific requirements of a given scenario, facilitating a tailored approach to quantum error correction.'
