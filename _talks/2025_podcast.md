I strongly recommend listening to this to anybody who is considering doing a PhD or is already going through that journey. Listen on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKRcqTDhUn8&ab_channel=GenesisofTomorrow) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1VerV8ezzKDT9BHCfkSPJZ?si=XlXsYIvlQ9ScPTIKzCQuQw&nd=1&dlsi=bbcd2f03861e4032).
