My name is Avimita Chatterjee, and I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at The Pennsylvania State University. My research centers on Quantum Computing, with a specific focus on Quantum Error Correction (QEC). I have the privilege of working under the guidance of Professor Swaroop Ghosh, exploring how to build more resilient and scalable quantum systems.

My journey into QEC began with a deep curiosity about quantum technologies and a strong desire to make their potential accessible to more people. As a computer scientist entering a field traditionally dominated by physics and mathematics, I quickly realized the value of diverse perspectives. My goal is to break down the barriers around QEC and make it more approachable for researchers from a variety of backgrounds.

Research in Quantum Error Correction
======
Quantum Error Correction is one of the most essential yet complex components of quantum computing. It addresses the fragile nature of quantum information and is crucial for building fault-tolerant quantum systems. My research is focused on optimizing the use of space and time resources in QEC, reducing the overhead associated with error correction protocols, and designing scalable, efficient solutions.

Throughout my doctoral work, I have authored eighteen research papers, ten of which I led as the first author. These publications form the foundation of my dissertation and represent years of detailed exploration into the practical challenges and opportunities in QEC. In recognition of my work, I was honored with a nomination for the Outstanding Research Assistant Award at Penn State.


Industry Experience: Internship at QED-C
======
During the summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to intern at the Quantum Economic Development Consortium (QED-C), managed by SRI International. My project focused on benchmarking the performance of quantum Hamiltonians, a topic central to understanding and improving quantum simulations.

The result of this work was a paper titled “A Comprehensive Cross-Model Framework for Benchmarking the Performance of Quantum Hamiltonian Simulations.” I served as the lead author of this paper, which was accepted for presentation at the American Physical Society (APS) Global Physics Summit 2025 and published in the IEEE Transactions on Quantum Engineering journal. This project not only expanded my research expertise but also marked a significant milestone in my academic career.

You can read more about my internship experience in a featured article on the QED-C blog [here](https://quantumconsortium.org/publication/confusion-clarity-and-quantum-highs-a-summer-at-the-qed-c/?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8PhycQDLFWXNtbEp4AiRBcgeNSkjhmpyH_tognbDJEwxPOMy-P9j7CxpShx7e591GssGVW).


Educational Background and Professional Experience
======
I earned my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from the Institute of Engineering and Management (IEM), Kolkata, affiliated with West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT), in 2018. During my undergraduate studies, I received the Director’s Award for Best Student Contribution in recognition of my academic and extracurricular involvement.

Before beginning my Ph.D. journey, I worked as a Software Developer and Quality Assurance Lead at I2I TeleSolutions and TeleMedicine in Bangalore, India. There, I led the development of a telemedicine application, guided the company through an ISO 9001 certification audit, and was honored with an Award of Appreciation for successfully implementing the Quality Management System.


Making Quantum Knowledge Accessible
======
A major part of my mission as a researcher is to make quantum computing more accessible. Having entered the field from a computer science background, I know how overwhelming it can be to navigate its steep learning curve. To help others make that transition, I have created a series of approachable resources titled “For Dummies” papers, including: Quantum Error Correction for Dummies, Quantum Random Access Memory for Dummies, and Lattice Surgery for Dummies.

These resources are written with clarity and simplicity in mind, offering an entry point into complex quantum topics for students, professionals, and curious learners alike.

In addition, I am currently writing a book on quantum computing aimed at younger readers and absolute beginners. This book is designed to be playful, clear, and engaging—something that anyone can pick up and understand. My goal is to spark interest, curiosity, and confidence in the next generation of thinkers and innovators.


Supporting Students and Building Community
======
Having gone through the challenges of graduate school myself, I am deeply committed to supporting others on their academic journeys. I believe that pursuing a Ph.D. should not be a solitary experience, and I actively encourage students to reach out with questions, whether academic, emotional, or logistical.

Mentoring new students in my lab has been one of the most fulfilling parts of my experience at Penn State. I work closely with each student to help them navigate the complexities of quantum research, and I aim to create an environment where they feel supported, inspired, and confident in their abilities.


Advocacy and Leadership in STEM
======
As a woman of color working in the specialized field of quantum computing, I am passionate about increasing diversity and inclusion in science and engineering. I am actively involved in outreach initiatives such as Girls In Quantum, where I contribute to projects and collaborations aimed at promoting diversity in the quantum community.

My commitment to service also includes peer reviewing for leading academic journals such as Nature Partner Journals - Quantum Information, Quantum Information Processing, The Journal of Supercomputing, and IEEE Computer Architecture Letters. I have served on the Technical Program Committee for IEEE Quantum Week in both 2024 and 2025.

I have delivered invited talks at institutions and events including Penn State’s Department of Mathematics, the Silicon Valley Quantum Computing Group, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and the Genesis of Tomorrow Podcast. Through these engagements, I aim to contribute to the scientific community while encouraging more inclusive participation in emerging fields like quantum computing.


Get in Touch
======
If you are curious about quantum computing, are considering research in this field, or simply want to connect, I would be happy to hear from you. Whether you are a student, researcher, or an enthusiast, let us work together to make science more open, inclusive, and impactful.









This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

A data-driven personal website - Avimita
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
